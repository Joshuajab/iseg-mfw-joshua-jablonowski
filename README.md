### Abstract

This paper investigates fiscal sustainability and the prevailing fiscal regime in the Fed- eral Republic of Germany. First, using annual data from 1950 to 2023, the analysis as- sesses the time series properties of key fiscal variables via unit root tests that account for multiple structural breaks (Carrion-i Silvestre et al. 2009). The long-term relationship be- tween the primary balance and government debt is then estimated using a single-equation error correction model (SECM). The results from this long-term analysis do not support the hypothesis of fiscal sustainability, and the SECM proves inconclusive in identifying a dominant fiscal regime, showing a statistically insignificant long-run coefficient and bidi- rectional Granger causality. To analyze recent fiscal dynamics, the paper then employs the local projections method described by Jordà (2005) on quarterly data from 2002 to 2023. In stark contrast to the long-term findings, this impulse response analysis reveals a clear Money-Dominant (MD) regime. A discretionary positive shock to the primary balance leads to a significant a decrease in real government debt, a result consistent with the MD regime. The divergent findings suggest that while Germany’s long-run fiscal framework is ambiguous, its policy dynamics in the 21st century have been characteristic sustainable fiscal practices.


### About this Repository

This repository serves as the online appendix for the Master's thesis "Fiscal Regimes and Sustainability: Insights from Post-War Germany (1950-2023)". It contains all the data, R code, GAUSS code, and output necessary to reproduce the empirical analysis presented in the paper.

### Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:
- `/mfw_data/`: Contains the raw data files used in the analysis.
  - `pfmh_data.xlsx` is the data used for the ECM and GAUSS analyses.
  - `/mfw_lprfs_data/`: Contains all quarterly `.csv` files for the LP analysis.
- `/mfw_code/`: Contains all scripts required to run the analysis.
  - `/mfw_analysis_gauss/`: Contains the GAUSS code for descriptive statistics, plots, and the unit root tests.
  - `/mfw_analysis_r/`: Contains all the R scripts, logically grouped into subfolders.
    - `/mfw_ecm/`: All scripts related to the Error Correction Model analysis the results can be reproduced by running the script `mfw_ecm_results.R`.
    - `/mfw_lprfs/`: All scripts related to the Local Projections analysis, the plot can be reproduced by running the script `mfw_lprfs_results`.
    - `/mfw_ecm_output/`: Stores the intermediate data (`df_global.rds`) and final model objects (`best_*.rds`) generated by the ECM scripts.
    - `/mfw_lprfs_output/`: Stores the intermediate data (`df_lprfs_global.rds`), identified shocks (`df_lprfs_shocks.rds`), and final plots generated by the LP scripts.

### How to Reproduce the Analysis

To reproduce the results, please run the scripts in the following order. All R scripts use the `here` package and assume the working directory is the root of the RStudio Project (`master_final_work.Rproj`).

Part 1: Unit Root Tests (GAUSS)

The Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2009) unit root tests, the results of which are reported in **Table II** of the thesis, were performed externally using GAUSS.
1. **Software:** Requires GAUSS statistical software.
2. **Code Location:** The main test scripts are located in `/mfw_code/mfw_analysis_gauss/mfw_stationarity_test/`.
3. **Input Data:** The scripts load data from `.gdat` files located in the same folder. These `.gdat` files are generated from the primary data source (`pfmh_data.xlsx`) using the `retrieve_data.gss` helper script.
4. **Execution:** Run the `stationarity_test_*.gss` scripts (e.g., `stationarity_test_debt.gss`) to generate the unit root test statistics for each variable.
5. **Source:** The GAUSS code is an implementation of the M-class tests and was retrieved from the `gauss-carrion-library` provided by Eric, C. (2020).

Part 2: Error Correction Model (ECM) Analysis in R

All scripts are located in `/mfw_code/mfw_analysis_r/mfw_ecm/`.
1. `mfw_ecm_data_prep.R`: This script loads the annual data and generates the comprehensive data frame `df_global.rds`, saving it to the `/mfw_ecm_output/` folder.
2. **Model Selection (Non-Linear Model)**:
   - `mfw_ecm_nls_aic.R`: Identifies the optimal lag structure for the non-linear ECM. Saves the best model to `best_nls_ecm_model.rds`.
3. **NLS Model Analysis**:
   - `mfw_ecm_nls.R`: Loads `best_nls_ecm_model.rds` and provides robust coefficient tests. The final results are presented in **Table III** of the thesis.
4. **Model Selection (Linear Models)**:
   - `mfw_ecm_granger_aic_b.R`: Identifies the optimal lag structure for the linear ECM with `b_t_lag1` as the dependent variable.
   - `mfw_ecm_granger_aic_s.R`: Identifies the optimal lag structure for the linear ECM with `s_t` as the dependent variable.
5. **Granger Causality Tests (Linear Models)**:
   - `mfw_ecm_granger_b.R`: Loads the best linear model for the `b_t` equation and performs robust Wald tests.
   - `mfw_ecm_granger_s.R`: Loads the best linear model for the `s_t` equation and performs robust Wald tests. The combined results from these two scripts are presented in **Table IV** of the thesis.

Part 3: Local Projection (LP) Analysis in R

All scripts are located in `/mfw_code/mfw_analysis_r/mfw_lprfs/`.
1. `mfw_lprfs_data_prep.R`: Loads and processes all quarterly data, saving the merged data frame `df_lprfs_global.rds` to the `/mfw_lprfs_output/` folder.
2. `mfw_lprfs_shocks.R`: Loads the quarterly data, estimates a VAR, and applies the Blanchard & Perotti (2002) identification methodology to derive structural fiscal shocks.
3. `mfw_lprfs_lp.R`: This script performs the final analysis. It loads the prepared data and identified shocks, estimates the impulse response function using local projections (`lp_lin_iv`), and saves the final plot. This plot is presented as **Figure 3** in the thesis.

### System and Software Requirements

The analysis was conducted using the following software:
- **R version 4.3.2**
- **GAUSS version 25.0.1**
